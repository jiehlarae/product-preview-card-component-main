### What I learned

This was my first challenge on frontendmentor.io, and I encountered a hurdle with my content overflowing its containers. I used ChatGPT to pinpoint minor errors and dived into a few YouTube tutorials to gain proficiency in the proper utilization of min-height, height, and max-height. In the end, I resolved the issue by modifying the font size of my h1 and certain paragraphs for smaller screens.


### Continued development

I still feel a bit uncertain when it comes to utilizing CSS flexbox and managing height and width. Hence, I aim to delve deeper into these topics to strengthen my understanding and gain confidence.
